# Chatbot with QDrant and LangChain using Gemini and OpenAI

## Introduction

This project implements a chatbot using QDrant and LangChain, with two approaches: Gemini and OpenAI. The chatbot is developed in the Google Colab environment and is capable of understanding and responding to user queries using large language models.

## Features

- **QDrant Integration:** Utilizes QDrant for storing and querying text embeddings.
- **LangChain Framework:** Integrated with LangChain to build natural language processing pipelines.
- **Gemini API:** Uses Gemini's API to interact with its language models.
- **OpenAI API:** Leverages OpenAI's API to interact with GPT-3/4 models.

## Usage Guide

1. **Choose the approach:**
   - You can select whether to use Gemini or OpenAI as the backend for the chatbot. This is configured in the initial setup of the notebook.

2. **Enter a query:**
   - Use the input field to ask questions or interact with the chatbot. The chatbot will respond based on the selected model.

3. **Adjust and fine-tune:**
   - You can customize the processing chain in LangChain to improve the chatbot's performance.
