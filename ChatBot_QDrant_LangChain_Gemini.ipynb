We believe that every dog is special, so we will share photographs of some of our rescued puppies and dogs throughout this book. We hope that you enjoy them! Are you interested in knowing more about the diﬀerent kinds of dogs?  There is great information on the internet, and you can ﬁnd out just about anything you want to know. But it’s important to go to the right place to get correct information. The best places to ﬁnd correct information are animal sites, like a vet clinic or vet hospital. The ASPCA website has great resources too.  You can ﬁnd Facebook Pages that have information on dogs. There are books online, at the library and in stores.  Your local pet store will also have books and magazines about dogs.There are television shows that are just for dogs.  We’ll tell you more about those in this book too.\n",

Remember, while you go to school, or out with friends, your dog will miss you. While your dog will enjoy your company while you are busy with other activities, he will also need special activity planned just for him.  Below are some fun activities you can enjoy with your pet:Walking - A long walk twice a day will keep your dog healthy. Some dogs love to walk fast, and others like to walk slower.
